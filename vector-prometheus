. The Immediate Failure: Connection Refused
Metric: vector_http_client_errors_total Current Status: CRITICAL

Your logs are not reaching the destination. The metrics show distinct connection errors for my_sink_id.

Plaintext

vector_http_client_errors_total{component_id="my_sink_id", error_kind="...Connection refused..."} 11
What it tells you: Vector tried to connect to your HTTP endpoint 11 times and was rejected every time (OS error 61).

Action: Check if the external log store is down, or if the URL/Port in your vector.toml is incorrect.

2. The Safety Net: Buffer Usage
Metric: vector_buffer_byte_size vs vector_buffer_max_byte_size Current Status: SAFE (Working)

Because the sink is down, Vector has switched to writing logs to your disk buffer.

Plaintext

# How much space you are currently using (1.3 KB)
vector_buffer_byte_size{buffer_id="my_sink_id", ...} 1352 

# Your configured limit (~268 MB)
vector_buffer_max_byte_size{buffer_id="my_sink_id", ...} 268435488
What it tells you: You have used 1352 bytes out of 268 MB. You have plenty of runway.

Alert Rule: Trigger a warning when buffer_byte_size > 80% of max_byte_size. If this fills up, you will start dropping logs.

3. The "Silent" Failure: Stalled Events
Metric: vector_buffer_events Current Status: STALLED

Plaintext

# Total events entered the buffer
vector_buffer_received_events_total{buffer_id="my_sink_id"...} 6

# Total events currently sitting in the buffer
vector_buffer_events{buffer_id="my_sink_id"...} 6
What it tells you: 6 events came in, and 6 are still sitting there. Zero have been successfully sent.

Monitor: If vector_buffer_events is growing while vector_component_sent_events_total (for the sink) is flat, your pipeline is clogged.

4. The Data Loss Signal (Missing is Good)
Metric: component_discarded_events_total Current Status: HEALTHY

I searched your dump for vector_component_discarded_events_total and it is not present.

What it tells you: You have not lost any data yet. Vector successfully moved the logs from the file source into the disk buffer.

Monitor: If this metric appears in your scrape, it means the disk buffer is full or corrupted, and logs are being deleted.

Summary of what is happening right now:
Your Go app wrote 6 log lines to the file.

Vector read them (Source my_file_source is healthy).

Vector tried to send them to my_sink_id and failed (Connection refused).

Vector moved those 6 lines into the Disk Buffer.

Vector is now waiting and retrying.
